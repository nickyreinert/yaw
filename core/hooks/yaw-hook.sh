# YAW hook shim (ADR-0006), written by YAW to .yaw/bin/yaw-hook; agents run it as `sh .yaw/bin/yaw-hook ...`.
# It finds the kit and runs `yaw hook "$@"` in the project root. It fails open: without Node or the
# kit it exits 0 with no output, so the agent session is never affected.
# Shell builtins only until node runs, so a broken PATH cannot print errors.
